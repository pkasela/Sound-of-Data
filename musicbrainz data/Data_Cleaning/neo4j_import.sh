# so, it seems too easy but it is not: we have to change the tsv
# structure to fit this script, it is not so easy but we have to do
# it.
# What does change: everything, so I just write a simple structure of
# how files have to be constructed to be insered in the graph:
# (fill free to modify the structure, but first and last columns of
# nodes table must be nodes'id and nodes'type
#                              (first:last {prop1, prop2...})
